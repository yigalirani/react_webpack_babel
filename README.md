# react_webpack_babel
Simple and maintainable skeleton for npm react webpack projects

This project is an alternative to `npx create-react-app`. The advantage is that all the webpack and babel setting are specified explicitly rather than hidden away in `react-scripts`. This way, it is easier to understated and modify. 

This project is based on https://blog.usejournal.com/setting-up-react-webpack-4-babel-7-from-scratch-2019-b771dca2f637
